# OpenAPI Specification

We used the content from the [**OpenAPI Specification**](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) repository, maintained it via git submodule, but it was complicating the contribution. We decided to copy the example content into the moclojer repository.

> **TODO:**
> Many examples are not used, in the future we have to clean up this folder and keep only the examples we use
